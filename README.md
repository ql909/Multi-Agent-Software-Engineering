# Scenario:

A family run bicycle company has been in operation since 1973, and has become a major employer in the local area. Unfortunately, due to cheaper imports from overseas countries and general market conditions, they are struggling with finances and are looking at a way to cut costs.

Currently their production line is manually operated, and the company may consider cutting costs by bringing in modern automation. As a specialist group in Multi Agent Systems, you have suggested to the company that a Multi Agent Systems approach to bicycle production may be an avenue that is worth exploring.
